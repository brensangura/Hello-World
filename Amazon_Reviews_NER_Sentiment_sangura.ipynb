Also, the ending was just flat. It just suddenly ends with little, if anything, learned, nothing resolved, nothing changed, leaving one to wonder why the story was told in the first place. This may sound harsh, but I can still pick up any of her earlier stories and reread it, laugh, and be absolutely amazed all over again.

She is younger than me, so I don't think she had ever seen the First Season. By the end of First Season, we were both looking for more only to be disappointed when we returned to Amazon to see this is the only season out. Also, at the end of the last disc as a bonus is the first episode for the Second Season. It's a new family which is probably the one most people remember. The First Season was a total 5-Star for us.

However, my daughter has now outgrown the sling and can't sit up on her own yet. The instructions say that you should detach the bottom portion of the sling and use it as a headrest but the problem is that the seat in the tub is not deep enough to hold the baby and she slides down into the bottom portion of the tub. Luckily, I never take my hands off of her while she is in the tub so she has never gone under but I can see how it could happen very easily. This is a great tub if your child can sit up and you want a small tub to bathe them in. It's also great for newborns but there is a three or four month window where it is useless. I'm tossing mine out. I bought the Primo Eurobath and it is much safer and will last much longer... probably until she is three years old.\n",

            "Review: Doesn't work from 2-6 months: I had the Safety First tub with my first baby and bought this when I had a boy, mostly for the colors. This is nowhere near as good as the Safety First. First, the newborn insert isn't big enough for big babies, my son outgrew it within 2 months. It's very poorly designed for a baby who isn't a newborn but can't quite sit up. There is nowhere for their head to go, no support, and my baby slumps over to the side. He's also easily able to kick himself out of the part that supports him under his butt, so if I look away for literally one second he's submerged over his face in water, it's extremely dangerous. It's a very awkward and uncomfortable position. When they do get old enough to sit up, half of the tub is dedicated to younger babies, so the space they have to play is much smaller.Get the Safety First with the newborn insert, you'll be much, much happier!\n",

Although, now that she is 3+ months it seems that 'the bump' located on the bottom of the tub is extremly uncomfortable. Bath time is no longer enjoyable for her as she arches her back to try and avoid the large plastic bump pressing against her back. I would not recommend this tub for babies over 13 pounds.\n",

The grooves and feel are there but it gets lost in the muddle of harsh mixing. I agree with the earlier reviewer who criticized the synth horns as it does make a difference on this album especially given the other problems. The reason groups like Theivery Corporation and the like are so good is that there is an organic feel to the music despite the use of electronics. On Heavens, rather than a warm full sound, there is just mashed layers of harsh, blunt electronics.I suspect this is a matter of needing a more experienced engineer on the CD. First albums are usually rough and maybe The Murgatroyd Trio can get the bugs worked out and shine in forthcoming releases.\n",

Now, I want nothing more than to throw it out the window every time I have to turn it on. Even if the monitor's been charging all night, the second you turn it on it starts crackling. My house isn't very big, but if I go more than 1 room away, the signal dies, the light goes red, and it starts beeping at me.I give it 2 stars because for the first 6 months, it worked pretty well.If you only need a monitor for a few months and have money to spare, by all means knock yourself out.

Social Services stepped in. I ran for a long time focussing on the lies that they accepted as fact (way too numerous to mention). I thought I was a great Mom. In many ways I was, but I now know I didn't teach my children boundaries. I grew up with none. I am still fighting for my four children, but in a very different way. I now spend the time I have with them totally focused. I try to help them to see how important boundaries are. Taking care of your self, does not mean you can't take care of someone else, in the long run, it is better for all. I didn't matter before. Today my children see a mother that cares about herself. I am working hard at learning my own boundaries and respecting the boundaries of others.This book has changed my perspective, thus changing my attitude.\n",

Don't get me wrong, he truly deserves to be called \"The Man\", but this is the soft-rock crap that most of his detractors despise. Elsewhere he makes good songs, both his own (Moondance, Gloria) and others (T-Bone Walker's Stormy Monday, Freddie King's Have You Ever Loved a Woman?, Sly Stone's Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin), James Brown's It's a Man's Man's Man's World) bad. I hate it when people do that.

No other person in the 20th century affected the lives of so many. Author Manchester has attempted a three volume biography (volume 2 ends at the start of World War II and volume 3 has not yet been published), which succeeds magnificently. The author brings Churchill alive, and like any great man, he is also flawed, and these are presented without apology. Manchester's style of writing and organization is superb. The story of Churchill's youth and young adulthood is thoroughly explored. The author puts special emphasis on Churchill's childhood and the effects of his relationship with his parents which became obvious throughout his life.I would recommend this book highly.\n",

Provide me a genuine inspiration and genuine desire to gather more knowledge and spread it others. He validates the notion that many of us have in the back of our minds. Do we we really have to be mean, ruthless, and selfish to be successful? Well, no we don't, and Tim tells you how you can be nice and smart and still succeed.The book provides a very clear and powerful method of what it takes to be what he calls a 'lovecat'. His book overflows with personal examples and personal motivations that convey his point across. It is so easy, and it just makes you just want to go out and become lovecat. This is a must read!\n",

The regular Nano doesn't come with the FM tuner or arm band. If you want to buy an arm band it costs another $20. For this extra $20 I could have bought the Nano Plus with the arm band and a FM tuner. I've only had the player for a short time and I had an issue when downloading songs to it. Apparently you have to put your songs into folders then move them into the player, not a big deal and the customer support was very quick in getting me an answer to this issue. I'm rating this item as a 2 because of the cost between it and the PLUS. I would recommend the player, but get the PLUS (which I would rate at a 4). Works great for my workouts, if only I had an arm band. Get the PLUS, have I said that enough.\n",

He has argued on the one hand that a black man is not entitled to a seat on the Supreme Court because of allegations that the man made a dirty joke (never mind that his accuser had serious credibility problems). Then he turns around and defends Bill Clinton against (much more credible) allegations of rape by arguing that \"gentlemen always lie about sex.\" The only problem with multiculturalism is its potential for creating a nation where no one can agree on what is right and what is wrong.

Over all the book is a great read that you'll fly through. Be sure to buy Sheisty & Still Sheisty part 2 at the same time(They're like kool aid and water you can't have one without the other) lol.

I read the original about ten years ago and found it somewhat difficult to follow. I thought it was just me, but this is commented on by Forsyth in his preface. His preface also gives a nice background on the story and the history of the actual Paris Opera House. If you have not read the original story and perhaps you just know the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, you won't have any trouble following the story. Forsyth follows the details from the musical more than from the novel, such as the fact that the monkey/music box plays \"Masquerade\". It is quite interesting to note that almost every chapter of the book is told by a different character, yet the story still flows smoothly. It is well written, with a lot of historical detail. I read the book in just a few short hours and I would suggest that Forsyth left room for himself or someone else to continue the story at a later time.\n",

            "Review: Incredibly disappointing book: The Phantom of Manhattan is an awful book in all regards. The foreword of the novel goes on about wanting to correct \"poor Gaston's\" mistakes in writing the novel, as well as making a long-winded argument about journalistic reporting. While the foreword manages to demean Gaston Leroux's classic The Phantom of the Opera, the main body Phantom of Manhattan fails to really do anything. Any psychological complexity from the original novel is completely gone, as is any vestige of the original characters; they are all mere shadows, simplistic and one-dimensional. Meanwhile, the plot is mildly reminiscent of the original while being nowhere near as engaging. The use of multiple narrators does nothing for the story; instead, it distances you from the story, because the point of view jumps around so much while never getting near any of the main characters. This is not anywhere near the quality of the original book; don't waste your time reading it.\n",

Part of Forsyth's problem is that he had no respect for the original story (he actively dislikes Leroux's original, which he talks about in the introduction in my copy), and it shows. Why on earth would you write a sequel to a book you don't even like?! If he thinks he's made any improvement on the original, he's seriously mistaken.If Andrew Lloyd Webber decides to make a musical sequel based on this novel, I predict it'll fail faster than \"Rags\" did (although \"Rags\" was actually good, and this wouldn't be anything approaching good or even decent).\n",

This visual diary and commentary provides a fascinating contemporary portrait of the living conditions in Caracas. While squatter settlements, known as \"barrios\" in Venezuela, have been around for decades, the extent to which the formal, planned urban areas in Caracas have been surrounded and overtaken by the informal city is astonishing. In the 60's there were many ambitious plans to develop and redevelop major parts of the city, but these have, on the evidence presented here, not materialized. Instead, people have continued to migrate from the rural areas, drawn by the allure of the big city and the possibilities for a better life. Breathtaking.\n",

Don't waste your time OR money. Buy something worth reading.I'm sure Ms. Moore is a very nice person. But I hope she hasn't given up her day job yet.\n",

It stuck me that Clancy's formula is getting stale, he is getting lazy, or he finished writing this book in a hurry in order to meet a publishing deadline. The first 500 pages of this 600 page book resemble a typical Clancy effort with multiple plot lines and heavy detail. However, at about the 500 page mark it is as if Clancy decided he had to wrap this book up in a hurry. Anticipation and suspense disappear, and plot developments become predictable because of the known history about the attempt on Pope John Paul II's life. As a result, the story falls flat. Like many other authors that have sought to wring every possible story out of characters that have captured readers imaginations, Clancy's imagination seems to have reached the bottom of the barrel with Jack Ryan in Red Rabbit.\n",

Clancy uses the same terms and expressions over and over and over again, and he took poetic licence with the dates (the actual assissination attempt occurred in May 1981 and not August-September 1982) and he misspelled Cardinal Wyszynski's name (minor typo, I know, but it still bothered me).Clancy wasted an opprtunity to write a heck of a thriller.

I was eagerly looking forward to reading his newest installment, but it did not take long to realize that completing this epic would be challenging, at best. The pages and pages of forced dialogue from the Ryans and the Foleys were excruciating. The conversations between these married couples seemed to have been written by a 13 year old girl. Does anyone really talk like that? And the constant references to Cathy's times at Johns Hopkins and Jack's at Merrill Lynch were not only repetitive, but lame as well. There was little excitement or suspense throughout, and the historical references and timeline seemed to be entirely out of accurate context. Overall, an extremely disappointing read.\n",

There are several egregious errors, e.g. a paragraph where she mentions that the heroine of *Pastel* is jealous of her \"elder\" sister. This is not a forgivable lapse, as another reviewer would have it; this is a slap in the face when writing about an author whose books were so meticulously and lovingly researched.Ms. Hodge seems to have had either too little or too much affection for Ms. Heyer and I think it shows. The biography is lavishly illustrated and she mentions each of Heyer's works by name, but the rest of it is oddly lacking, and overall disappointing. Far better to curl up with a good Heyer book than to waste your time with this.\n",

But I just didn't care for the character of Fiona at all. Not my type of person so I didn't care for reading about her at any cost. I loved the character of John; he's a doll! Fiona was nothing but a self centered, self absorbed woman who thought only of herself and how she can constantly benefit herself. I have no idea what John saw in her; I guess it was her beauty. Talk about total opposites! I don't blame his daughters for disliking her! The other women in Danielle's books were much nicer and had much better personalities. Because of Fiona, I didn't enjoy the book at all. I couldn't wait to finish it. I was hoping that he would leave her altogether and find someone more to his liking. Unfortunately he stuck by her.\n",

It kind of reminds me of a modern, quirky fairy tale: the love story between Mr. Armadillo and Mrs. Armadillo is quite sweet. The book is also visually interesting, with a lot of colors, imagination, and unexpected exaggerations. My girls are 3 and 4, and they really like it. They are interested in babies and also in the idea that babies start out inside the mother's stomach. This book obviously contained those things. Among the gifts given to the family are ten potties for the ten babies, and potties are always fun. (There's also ten baseball hats, ten tutus, and ten pets.)It's a fun book.

The special effects, especially the Vogon fleet, look like the SFX people were lazy and they didn't care how the effects came out, the Vogons were unconvincing (and they would have been done better with live actors), Deep Throat and Magrathea seemed to be tacked on to the plot as an afterthought and we didn't have to see the Vogon homeworld. Give us missiles turned into a sperm whale and a bowl of petunias instead of John Malkovich anyday. The only good thing was the voice of Marvin.

The trade-off is knowing that what you are reading is the source of the idea rather than a reflection of it. While I bought this book as a class requirement, reading it (and I am nowhere near done) has offered me new perspectives to not only view literature, but the world in general.

The Trouble with Testosterone is a collection of essays covering a range of subjects more (or less) tied to behavioral biology - the study of the extent to which our behaviour is influenced by our bodies and our bodies by our behaviour.M. Sapolsky's approach is thoughtful and addresses not only some of the really nifty developments in the field, but also some of the thorny philosophical issues arising from what we think we know (and what we thought we knew but didn't). Whether discussing the social interactions of aging baboons, the extent to which testosterone does not affect aggression, an important difference between 1/2 and (1/4 + 1/4), or the risks in deciding too readily what is normal, M. Sapolsky usually has something interesting to say, and for the most part says it well.The Trouble with Testosterone is a keeper on my bookshelf.\n",

The book starts out promising, and Markoe's writing is breezy, funny, and occasionally clever. Midway through, however, the incessantly bleak existence of the main character wears you down, and the writing becomes heavy-handed and over-the-top. The character becomes less and less sympathetic, because she does not mature or learn anything with each passing year, and continues to make the same relationship mistakes over and over again. There are those that would argue that this is a lot like real life, but one would think that a book would have a higher purpose to entertain. Unfortunately, there's nothing entertaining about this sad, lonely, mixed-up woman with low self-esteem who spends an inordinate amount of time obsessing over minute relationship details, and expects us to care.\n",

It's also very easy to use and the built-in rechargable battery is a smart feature. Unfortunately, it has one critical flaw. The display is so bright that it's practically unusable at night time in a dark bedroom. Even in the dimmed state it lights up half the room. In addition, when the battery is charging, an extremely bright blue LED light (ever more overused in electronics these days) next to the power button keeps flashing until charging is complete. Unless you sleep in a very bright room (next to a street light) and have many night lights in your room, I would not recommend this radio. Perhaps a future R3 will replace the LED with an ambient light sensor to automatically adjust brightness. For the price I paid, I decided to keep it and use it in the garage.\n",

Lina, the ultra sorceress of an alternate universe, slums around and attracts more fellow travellers then troubles. This first series is a single story in some ways, but gets confused and lost in minutia. Lina and company are great to watch, but the action sequnces and designs are less then thrilling, however the humor is quite good (the kissing fish episode was really memorable). The side kicks pile on as the creator decides he doesn't know what he wants to write about, or how to make decent character interaction with a minimal cast. I purchased these videos as they came out and thought of them as cheap comic books- view once and put in a closet for eternity. Entertaining, yes, but not engaging or skillful. This series is probably best appreciated by the pre-pubescent anime fan.\n",

Furthermore, although Gandhi promotes non-violence outside the home, within his own home he is cruel and abusive particularly to his wife but also to his children--he did not practice what he preached. Many reviewers here mention his obsession with food and diet, which to me is indicative of eating disorders. Instead of interacting with people and truly caring about them, he constantly mentions the adulation he received. Ghandi clearly loved to be in control--he wanted to control his diet, he wanted to control people, and sex was abhorrent because he was not in control. My view of Gandhi was radically altered by reading this book.\n",

Alas, I found them much less than I had hoped for. The stories and the acting, with the possible exception of Kenneth More, seemed sophomoric and overdone. The secondary actors (several of whom I am familiar with from other films) were way over the top, shouting and declaiming far more than the part called for amd much more than I have seen them do elsewhere. While some of the stories were pretty good and some were really pretty bad, the acting almost without exception made me feel as though I were watching an amateur play.The episodes all had a very stage-y feeling that became very wearing after a while. All in all, this series was a severe disappointment.\n",

A few of his movies i like, Starman was one of them .. his newer movies stink, he is burnt out,, i have to say i liked Tron the 1st one, the second one, he came into it with a bit of a Laboskie attitude, and he was Burnt out!!! Bridges is Too Burnt out in my Book to even think about trying another fast paced Movie, he should stick to his burnt out Drama type figure, He acually slowed it dowwwwwnnnnnn!!!!!\n",

She's a gardening nut and constantly has a project going outside. She had trouble maneuvering the regular wheel barrow as it was large and too cumbersome for her, especially up a hill(there's a few in her yard).

It lays flat to put stuff in it(she's usually transplanting flowers) and get where she needs to go. My mom is small, about 5'2, and this seems like its made for someone her size!

Based on most of what is called \"Country Music\" today this album is Country with a capital C. 2. As we all know, Alan can sure sing rockabilly and honky-tonk , but he can take a ballad and sign it like few can except classic singers like Ray Price, George Jones, Charlie Pride , Ralph Stanley and others. Both his choice of ballads and his arrangements are top notch. After his wonderful Gospel cd, this is another gem.\n",

Being a huge AJ fan, I bought the CD the day it came out and couldn't wait to hear what else he had to offer - especially since the title cut was literally playing in my head day and night. I figured that maybe he asked Alison Krauss to produce the one song and then the rest of the CD would be usual AJ fare.I listened to it one time through and thought...what the @#&%?!I put it down a few days and put it back on my CD player. I feel much better about it now than I did a few days ago. It is a departure of sorts for Alan...not what one would expect. However, I believe this album will bring him some critical acclaim from those who normally don't listen to his usually \"Gone Country-esque\" style. It's pure...it's simple and sometimes understated.

She had Alan's CD, as well as some other CDs on for background music. All the music was pleasant, but when Alan's came on I dropped out of the conversation going on around me, and just listened to him. Pretty soon I was pointing out to everyone the gorgeous and pure voice of this talented country singer, and the great songs that were included on this unique CD. Within a short time everyone's focus was on Alan's music and we were all very happy with just being quiet and listening. Next day, I went out and purchased this CD and can't stop listening to it. I absolutely love this Alan Jackson, not that the other one was not great, too; but I agree with the reviewer who said, \"This is Alan's best CD to date.\" It's different, very romantic, and fun -- all in one!

I skimmed through the whole thing in 20 minutes, because I knew from reading the first few pages that it was going to be pretty nonsubstantial. Well, that's OK. The frame-love-story was just pathetic, the new mommy's gushings were trite, and the tragic event I won't spoil for those who actually care didn't come as much of a surprise. However, when the other shoe dropped, I DID cry--but at the same time I realized how I was being emotionally manipulated. The whole climax of the book shows that the entire book was a set-up to elicit maximum tears from the reader. It worked. AND, the actual conclusion of the book was so LAME I threw the book across the room. The last time I did that James Joyce was involved.\n",

What's so bad about this book?1) It's only one step above Dick and Jane. The simplistic writing style grated on my nerves.2) Even the most inattentive reader could plainly see that The Perfect Man (Matt) would never cheat on his wife, and therefore any reader could easily predict the outcome. Excessive foreshadowing insults readers' intelligence.3) Suzanne's and Matt's level of optimism and happiness was so far off the charts that they were completely unbelievable characters. \"Aren't we lucky?\" Psychotic maybe.4) The fact that Suzanne described her sex life in her diary to her baby made absolutely no sense.5) Patterson's use of pop culture references was excessive, lazy, and purposeless.All that criticism aside, I finished it, so it's not the worst book ever written.

The first complaint I have about it is that on the second time I went to use it, the zipper snapped right off. Now, it only has one zipper- verses some products that give you the double zipper for convenience or in case one breaks. So that left me coming up with a quick fix before running out the door. The second thing that left much to be desired was the fact that the ice packs are sewn in, which means you have to put the whole cooler in the freezer. This means you either have to put it in a plastic bag to keep outside germs away from your freezer, or you have to clean it off before putting it next to the frozen food.

I'm still undecided as to if I will spend the extra money to purchase the 3 disc version of New Moon or not, but I think that for any true Twilight Saga fan the 3 disc version of the movie Twilight is a good pick. Love it!!\n",

I'm not usually into the whole \"fantasy world\" kind of movies, but my wife is...so we watched TWILIGHT. Obviously geared towards the younger generation (we're in our late 30s with no children), I was surprised by how entertaining the story was framed about a young outcast female student being attracted to the \"weird\" guy that nobody messed with. The special effects in this film were pretty awesome, including the running up the mountain and swinging through the woods scenes. The baseball scene was also pretty incredible and added a visual complement to the storyline. Not a bad movie at all, but I'm not sure what all the hysteria was about. Other than to sell DVDs.\n",

Ordered the dvd with the bonus of free viewing. Right at the climax of the film, the movie went defunct. After Amazon's lengthy reload, we lost the movie repeatedly. When we had it, the quality was terrible, fuzzy enough so faces were actually indistinct on a large screen HDTV. After 3 long losses, with 12 minutes left in the film the show simply stopped. Amazon seemed to blame my internet connection-- yet I have Netflix and Roku and have NEVER had a similar (or any) problem with their delivery-- and they use the same internet. Besides having difficulties at the outset- it took an hour to get the film up and running, Amazon has cannot deliver the final scene and I have no idea if I will see the end.

Ryo-ohki OAV3 boxset, but for completely different Tenchi series or movies which have their own merits and defects.Before they lumped everything together last year or the year before that, this particular product had 2-1/2 stars and 8-9 reviews or thereabouts. Amazon certainly doesn't send you all the products for the price of one! But somehow saw the need to hide all the negative reviews by this tactic.OAV3 just has my scorn. It's certainly not in the spirit of OAV1/2, it relies heavily on the background which was never officially translated into English, and a lot of characters/situations come out of nowhere because of that. I didn't like it but others may.My greater concern is how Amazon is treating it's customers like crap by lying to them in their faces -- if you didn't read the reviews carefully, you may be thinking this is a 5-star product. It is not.\n",

Instead, I'll say that I found this book to be charming, warm, and rich with the minute detail that brings settings and people alive and makes you feel as if they're real and you're there with them.

Heavy weighted base with rubber or spiked feet for carpet. I put the spiked feet inside when I assembled the stands so in case we ever move and I need to use them I'll know where they are. My only complaint is there isn't some kind of keeper to hold the cord in the notch on the bottom so when you move them to vacum or clean the cord comes out of the notch and the stand wont sit level until you move the cord back into the notch. Been meaning to place a bit of gaffers tape on it. Very very pleased with these.

Go ahead: Say that Grunge isn't about melody, but any WORTHWHILE music is. If you take away the elitist label, then you have to judge it on its own merits. And that's what I'm judging As Good as Dead by. It's a shame Local H couldn't have cranked out another ten songs like those for this album... even if the band does try its hardest at ripping off Nirvana. Not that I care though: the two excellent songs on here are better than anything Cobain did.\n",

I wouldn't sell my copy of the soundtrack but I have to admit, I was a little disappointed to find that quite a few of the songs in the movie do not appear on the soundtrack. What further confused me was the fact that some of the songs less prominently featured in the movie were included on the cd, making the absence of the others that much more glaring. Makes you wonder what the producers of the cd were thinking by not including so much as a single track from the film's original score. I was excited to find the \"Suicide Hotline\" track on the cd, but was quickly disappointed by the fact it only runs 2:08. Still, I recommend the cd for hard-core \"Basquiat\" fans.

I only discovered \"Sex and the City\" from accidentally catching some reruns on syndicated TV, and liked it so much that I set about methodically renting every season from the beginning.The 4th season shows a big change in style from the first 3: production values have increased, pop music becomes more central, the episodes become more polished and tightly edited, the writing becomes a little bit more mature and creative (season 3 had some dead spots where a few episodes got a bit repetitive).So if you have a shorter attention span, you might find Season 4 is a good place to start. I enjoyed it as well as Seasons 1-3, but can't help noticing the perceptible shift. It's still one of the most intelligent, honest, and well-crafted TV shows to come out in the past 25 years.

If you're looking for creative and unique then look no further. As well, his delivery has a wicked humor and wit that never feels condescending.

Robert Redford, Ron Leibman, George Segal and Paul Sand provide plenty of witty repartee, and the bungled robberies are hilarious. Whenever the film starts to bog down, \"Bullit\" director Peter Yates and \"All the President's Men\" screenwriter William Goldman throw another wrench into the works, keeping the pace brisk, for example, introducing \"The Producers\" Zero Mostel as Sand's slightly unscrupulous lawyer father, or having Ron Leibman fly pell-mell in a helicopter through New York City. (Keep an eye out as they fly by the not yet completed World Trade Center.) If you're looking for a heist film less grim than the recent \"Blood Diamond,\" you probably won't be disappointed if you pick up \"The Hot Rock.\"Brr.\n",

But then it gets weaker and weaker until you find no end to \"The End\". At least not in the traditional Horror, Sci-fi genre. It's as if the director ran out of money and used a lenghty on-screen script to finalize his endeavor. The audience is left hanging with quite a bit of unresolved situations previously introduced. No resolve!The cinematography is awfully pale considering the location.The sets are droll.If you're going to do a \"true story\" piece you had better be right on or at least introduce a bit more melodrama to even the score.\n",

A incredible story of survival, friendship, and how one man can change the lives of everyone around him. Tim Robbins plays an innocent inmate convicted of killing his wife (although everyone is innocent in Shawshank!) who befriends Morgan Freeman, a man who knows how to get things on the inside. Through his determination and will, Robbins becomes the \"accountant\" of the prison and with these new relationships with the guards and warden, he wins over friends and trust. Freeman and Robbins become good friends and confide in each other, as Robbins plan is to escape the prison in search for his freedom that he has lost. \"Get busy living, or get busy dying.\" --Words to live by.\n",

However, unlike regular car seats that strap into a car from the back so that you can leave the car seat in a car and take the baby in and out without much trouble, this seat requires the seatbelt to strap OVER the baby! This is not only uncomfortable for the child, but a hassle because the seatbelt has to be undone and redone each time you get out of the car or every time you take the child out of the seat in the airplane. This may not seem like a big deal, but reaching over the child every time to find the buckle can be difficult and time consuming, and very uncomfortable to the child.

They were absolutely superb as feuding IRA brothers. I could have done without James Brolin. His character was out of place and his acting, as usual, leaves you unmoved. It's a movie worth watching on a rainy day. It is especially worth watching for the poem at the end - very moving.\n",

It plays with our imagination and takes our mind to a land of past where superstition was still part of every day life. It is enticing and thrilling and although written for children, it is just as good a read for adults.I have travelled to the Lausitz on the German-Czech border only because I had to go find the original locations. Due to the poverty suffered by East Germany after the construction of the Berlin wall, some of the rural areas have remained untouched by the gross developments of the sixties and seventies and what one finds today in the Lausitz is a land where time seemed to have stood still. Schwarzkolm and Kamenz are still just as beautiful as described in the book.\n",

When I made a mirror of my PC's hard drive, it hosed Thunderbird by adding a second In box, second sent folder, etc. I was never able to resolve/undo this. When I used the software to back up my recent data, instead of over writing the same folder, it kept making sub folders which I would later have to go and delete. After doing this a few times, the drive became nearly 20% fragmented and I had to use Windows to defragment the drive! I just got a new PC and tried to use this drive with Win7 and it would not recognize this drive. I called their tech support who said their was nothing they could do.

I'm hoping the OS upgrade will help with some of these bugs.If you are buying a CD-RW for it's looks and don't plan to use it for anything too big, this will work fine.

But it turns out that it is the exact opposite. There are numerous rules to remember and different combinations that aren't allowed to be near eachother and the border area is where he really loses you, the structure of the border changes the rules for the entire knot all of which must be memorized unless you want to end up with a jumble of loose ends.

Others are written with great beauty and poetry but have nothing to say.This book is of the former.Wilford Eng was a wonderful photographer. Of this, there can be no doubt. However, Orton seems to be playing upon the Eng unknowns or created unknowns so he can have something to make up for his lack of imagination. Otherwise, why would he pack his book with erotic sex and the like? If it is not sex that he is writing about then he digs up betrayal at every other dark corner of his almost literature of third rate porn.Now, all this may be excused if we, the reader comes away with a better understanding of himself, circumstance and philosophy.

The drummer (Ex-Angelcorpse) is very, very good, but his particular style of drumming resembles a family of monkeys beating on cooking pans.

There are supposedly 3 vocalists, but I have never heard anyone except for the lead vocalist. He has a very menancing growl.

At first I was a little leary (Peach always kind of annoyed me) but after I got the game and started playing it, I knew Nintendo had done it again and made another masterpiece! The game is a little easier than previous Mario games but it can still definitely be challenging! I enjoyed the mini games and the puzzles (you collect the pieces as you complete stages). After you beat the game for the first time you have to go back around and beat every stage again (while collecting new puzzle pieces and mini game stages). Every time you beat another boss, more stages get added to the next world. usually about 3 stages are added and they are relatively shorter than the original stages but definitely a nice addition.I liked the little twist Nintendo brought out in using Princess Peach's emotions as attacks. It was very original and it is fun and different.If you own a DS, this game is a must have.\n",

A serious throwback to the 70s as far as the humor goes. All those cracks at marriage and women that usually only old men make any more these days. Different times back then for sure.What was funny? Watching the audience's 70's hairdos and clothes and then squirming at their planted questions to Carol. If that amuses you buy the CD. If you want 'funny' stick to the you tube excerpts.\n",

I saw it on late night cable, and it was so disturbingly gross and twisted that it was all I could do to sit through it without hurling chips and beer I had just consumed. And yes, I intend this as a compliment, for it has always been Troma's aim to push it to the extreme. However, I can't imagine them pushing it any further, because there may not be any further to go.In the first 30 seconds of this movie, we see a guy get his leg ripped off and then used as a club to beat him to death, and a pregnant woman's fetus ripped from her stomach while she is still alive. These are some of the least graphic scenes in the movie, and the pace doesn't slow down for a second. If you're into this kind of thing (and you know who you are), you can't miss this movie. If you are disturbed by this kind of campy, wretched trash, then stay away. You have been warned.\n",

Soup's On is a different kettle of fish, meat, and lots of vegetables, including beans, beans, and more beans. Each recipe features a story about the ingredients or the person who contributed it. Did you know that peas have been found in 7,000 year-old Swiss Lake villages? That the spice cumin has been used to dye the robes of Buddhist monks yellow? That Benjamin Franklin suggested that the turkey, not the bald eagle, be designated the U.S. national bird? These tidbits and more entice this reader. My favorites among the recipes are Very Veggie Zuppa, with carrots and a sweet potato; Lucky 13-Bean Soup; Chicken Noodle Picante, with ginger and dried cayenne; Cow Puncher's Gullion, with ham and sauerkraut; and Shrimp File Gumbo.

The narrative alternates between authors Angela and Duffy Ballard, and that sets the book apart from other hiking memoirs. Seeing the hike from both perspectives invites the reader to share the experience with greater depth than most single-perspective narratives. It's almost as if we get to alternate sharing the trail with each author, hearing ones view of the trail tale before we hang back and join the other, listening to the same story with that author's particular way of looking at the adventure. Very quickly, the reader gets the sense of being on a hike with good friends. It helps that both writers do a terrific job of letting us see through their eyes. This book is strongly recommended for hikers, adventurers, and people interested in the way relationships develop in extreme situations.\n",

More importantly, his stories and reflections about Tommy and other friends serve as a genuine model for others to live up to and Stein never in the least part succumbs to a temptation to preach or talk down. After reading Tommy and Me, I get the impression that in addition to being a writer, television host, lawyer and economist he could have done quite well as a clergyman too.\n",

This is just the 3 Geffen CDs - CHER / Hear of Stone - 2nd album cover and LOVE HURTS - second album cover with the three liners shoved into a corner 4-spot. It is UN - B E L I E V A B L E that Geffen/Universal released such a disrespective compilation. I am in shock. ONCE AGAIN one of the greatest vocalists of our time gets the shaft. I will NEVER ever EVER understand who WHO is behind the incredible injustice given to this woman's recordings. This is so amazingly wrong. I thought for once \"they\" could get it right.

I have many reference books available to assist me in my writing, but nothing gives me such perfection as this one. Each event is noted briefly and accurately. Fact packed, all of the fluff has been removed.

Although he sings decent on most songs, he is far too often goofing off with the audience, in a manner not becoming of a superstar. Perhaps his other DVD release is a better production and provides a better representation of what Humperdinck show is actually like. This one is not a winner.\n",

            "Review: A Definite Classic: Cat Stevens' \"Tea For The Tillerman\" is truly a classic album, and classic albums don't get any classier than this. \"Tillerman\" boasts three well-known classic tunes: \"Where Do The Children Play\", \"Wild World\" and \"Father And Son\"(probably one of the smartest songs you'll ever hear on radio), but the fun doesn't end there, as every other song on the album has the makings of a classic. Here are a few standouts: \"Sad Lisa\" with its string arrangment is one of the album's best songs. \"Miles From Nowhere\" and \"But I Might Die Tonight\" are terrific rockers, the latter being my favourite song on the album - a brief tune about the monotony of the working day. \"Into White\" has a more traditional folk sound.With these songs in mind, its not hard to understand why \"Tea For The Tillerman\" has been a staple in folk and classic rock record collections since the day it was released. It is my favourite Cat Stevens album, and a wonderful album at that.\n",

Orlando Bloom (maybe it was in the script or maybe its just him) seemed like a whimp and uninspired the entire time. On the other hand, Susan Sarandon was amazing. As always, the music was phenomonal - I was on iTunes downloading music after the movie.Aside from all of this, the movie is great. Characters are colorful, the story of his father's death one that everyone can relate to, and the interaction and embarassment of family the viewer can really identify with.

While the novel has a lot of amusing moments--even bedroom farce--the surprises finally turn grim and unsettling. The author meditates (sometimes rather talkily) on Platonic concepts of love, on psychology, and on what is probably religion. \"Black Prince\" is gripping and motivated me to read it under forced draft. Be on notice that the two forewords are part of the novel and should be read as such. An Italian sonnet is left unattributed and untranslated. We are never told directly and explicitly why the protagonist is called \"The Black Prince.\"\n",

She follows a long line of baby catchers, and hers is a tale that you won't soon forget. The reader gets swept into her pre- war Appalacian world of influenzia, poverty and customs. Though she is barren, she raises the daughter of the man that she loves- but one who does not love her back. The reader desires almost as much as Elizabeth herself that she find someone who would be able to give her what she deserves- a husband who cares for her.

Before this, the Pixies were energetic, edgy and somewhat raw, all the way. After this (Trompe le Monde) they still had the same energy, but with a more complex sound and more beauty. The theme changed too, from incest and bodily harm to spacy weirdness. Bossanova seems to be the crossroad, and pulls it off nicely, but not perfectly. Some of the songs are excellent, like Velouria, Cecila Ann, Blown Away and Havalina. Other songs though...not so good. (Stormy Weather, a very boring song, comes to mind) That's probably the only flaw with this cd, is some songs are boring because they drag too much. I do enjoy this album though, and listen to it frequently. Anyone getting into the Pixies should first check out Surfer Rosa or Dolittle, then Trompe le Monde, and then finally get around to this little gem.\n",

Upon receiving it, I was surprised at the weight and stability compared to the Contractor Saw. The precision with the Biesemeyer Fence is outstanding; coupled with a very \"tunable\" miter slide, \"square and true\" is easier than before. The 4\" dustport and cabinet design make clean-up a piece of cake when used with my dust management equipment.Assembly was somewhat challenging to complete alone due to some of the cast iron weight, but with a \"helper\" it would most probably be a breeze. I substituted a cast iron BenchDog router mount with a Porter Cable 3.5HP router for the left table extension leaf.

However, after reading all of the glowing reviews I decided to move forward and all I can say is WOW!!! I can honestly say that no other traversal I have heard of the op 18 quartets even begins to compare to these glorious recordings.

The court room drama was fascinating, the acting is tight and the direction keeps you interested. The film doesn't hold back at any stage. A very good performance and it's good to see MM do a good job because he's not my favourite actor usually.

The Adventures of Pluto Nash is one of those movies.Eddie Murphy is great as the intrepid hero Pluto Nash as he fights the sinister space mafia. Originally, Nash was a small businessman who the mafia tries to shake down. However, Nash decides to fight the mafia in what turns out to be one of the most slapsticky sci-fi adventure flicks of all time. Thrills and spills abound in this wild and wacky funfest. Pluto Nash is a well-plotted futuristic sci-fi adventure story with a comedic bent.It also features a great cast with Rosario Dawson, Pam Grier, John Cleese, Randy Quaid, Peter Boyle and Jay Mohr.If you just want to relax and have fun while eating popcorn, then this is a great movie for you.\n",

So as not to sound completely negative, I admit that there are some genuinely entertaining moments and a surprise at the end, but the overall effect is rather flat.The scenery is pretty and John Cleese puts in a charming cameo; that's about all I can say is right with it. Not that there's much wrong, either, but rather it's a mediocre show with some glitz on top.

All we have to do is to cut the power cable off of the old unit and send it to them ( they will provide us a FedEx label in 7-10 days ).

Then to make matters worse, for some reason his vocal lines are mixed well below the level of the surrounding music, yes this hides flaws but I shouldn't have to borrow Charlie Watts’s hearing aid to hear Keith’s lyrics.I know, it's only rock and roll, but I do like it and it's hard to fully appreciate a work you can't access.

If you have dark hair and light skin, you will be able to see the stubble left behind. It is also very tedious to use, because it has to be kept up every day, it has to be stubble and no longer, and powder must be used. In certain areas it is difficult to manuveur and will not shave the hair all the way. It would be bad enough having to shave in the shower every day, but this makes it even more difficult because it must be done outside of the shower.The trimmer is the worst of all, it's loud and doesn't do a very good job. It cuts your skin very easily.I'd like to know what the \"pros\" or at least famous women use down there besides getting a wax.

I later saw bad reviews of the Micro Innovations low-end keyboard, but I assumed this one was far superior, for I'd a paid a premium price ... the princely sum of $10 ;)I was mistaken. After less than two months of moderate use (maybe the equivalent of three pages of text per day), the lettering on the \"n\" key wore away, and that's hardly the most used of all the keys. As I recall from the cryptograms I used to enjoy in elementary school, the frequency of letters in English is etaonrishdl ... so the \"n\" key should have lasted longer than four others.It got worse. Last night, after less than three months of usage, many of the keys just stopped working, rendering the keyboard totally useless. Nothing was ever spilled upon it and it sat in an air-conditioned and dust-free room.My conclusion? Buy a real keyboard and beware of trash on sale for cheap.\n",

At the end of the book, O'Rourke concludes that ANY form government is morally wrong. What? That's not libertarianism, that's anarchism. Sorry PJ, but all forms of social order require some form of coercion to maintain themselves (I'm reminded of the quip, \"We tried to set up an anarchic commune but nobody would follow the rules.\") Conservatives who feel that O'Rourke is on \"their side\" should also recognize that he not only has a low opinion of his government, but of his fellow Americans as well. He's a refugee from the sixties who never lost his contempt for America, he merely redesigned it to fit the changing political winds.

It deals, as all the MacGyver stories do, with issues of various sorts -- especially social and ecological problems -- that were current at the time of the original filming. I am amazed in retrospect at how extremely timely they actually remain. However, there are some delightful and intriguing plot twists, and I would rate the \"Christmas Episode\" of the fifth season, \"The Madonna\", as one of the all-time best stories I've ever viewed.\n",

An Australian--he and some of his comrades were the first to answer the call for providing aerial support to the ground offensive in Mesopotamia. However, his tour of duty was cut short after being captured in a daring behind the lines effort.The majority of the book centers on his captivity and eventual escape towards the end of the war. WHite's insights on his captivity are important; he was captured well before the fall of Kut, where the Turks had to deal with thousands of prisoners from the siege.Interesting anecdotal stories abound throughout the book.

When the timid Sarah Polley hoofs it to Iceland to confront her boyfriend's (literally) monstrous murderer, Robert John Burke, the two strike up an unlikely and uneasy friendship. So, Polley brings the horned creature to New York (shades of King Kong?), where her boss, tabloid TV producer Helen Mirren, wants to make him a star. Hartley's meditation on society's obsession with conformity and celebrity is intermittently engaging, but the relentlessness with which he drives home his points quickly jangles the nerves.

Lyrically and musically it is just stunning. This terrific album was recorded in only four days with a dream of a band backing him up (Ry Cooder on guitar, Nick Lowe on bass, and Jim Keltner on drums). A great album is at hand when there are no tracks that are skipped and when the album ends you feel a sense of urgency to listen to it again. This album is that good. There aren't any songs that are better than the other. Each track is solid perfection. From the soulful groove that kicks off \"Memphis in the Meantime\" to the last notes of \"Learning How to Love You\" there is not one bad second. No serious music afficianado should leave this album out of their collection. This is a masterpiece.\n",

Athough it will be difficult for many of you who classify Steve as a \"rock guitarist\" to appreciate his musicianship and his continuous strive to take the instrument to a new level, the rest of us can enjoy a CD filled with emotion, catchy riffs, unique rythms, and amazing guitar playing and composition. Unlike other CD's where Steve free-styles solos gratuitously by playing scale fragments and whammy tricks, on this CD each note seems purposeful and well thought out. A lot more introspecitve that his previous works. It has a 70's psychadelic and funk feel to it, which pays tribute to his Zappa inluence, but some cuts are very much straight ahead rock. Check it out. Vai fans will love it, and you kids who want to learn something about playing guitat, have a listen...your 90's guitar heroes don't even compare to this.\n",

His signing is improving, but I feel that sometimes he recycles melodies from his past disography. I'd liek to see him really go out and do a totally different guitar stle. Challenge himself and his audience. Mostly the cd is good, there are one or two stinkers, but nothing that ruins the cd. I love experimentation, so maybe that's why I like this. Plus the fact that Vai actually knows how to use Pro-Tools, unlike many bands. He has good tone, but on a few songs, it again seems recycled. I liked track 3 the most simply because it was effects he never used before.I hope he continues to expand. I see him perform in April, so I'll see how it sounds live. I will be excited.\n",

Unfortunately, this book did not help me understand that history, and I learned more in the 3 hour PBS \"Islam\" special the other night than in a month of reading this.One other complaint: the book could have really used a glossary.

I've yet to get close to 40 minutes using the crank charge. Perhaps that is due to being further from the city as well.

Westerfield will undoubtably be compared to William Gibson due to subject matter and writing style. Those who have read Gibson may recognize the setup which seems to be taken from his and Robert Shirley's short story \"The Belonging Kind\" (available in Gibson's collection, BURNING CHROME.) The aspects of being able to change genders, races and even body parts is explored in almost every way one can think of from impersonation to sexual uses.

I haven't yet tried to cook this rice dish on the stove, but although the microwave instructions require a bit of babysitting, stirring every few minutes, the end result is a slightly creamy rice and beans dish with a really great kick and aroma of cajun spices. Unlike most of the rice (with pasta usually cut in) dishes on the market, you can really smell it cooking from a room away, and when you first open the foil package the mix is kept in to stay fresh, you get a blast of the spices as well. You can tell at every stage that it's a high quality product, and it comes through in the end. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for either a great meal or a rice side dish for dinner.\n",

Well ... We worked on this for an hour and can't get the elevator to work right. There seem to be too many links in the chain and it is too slack to work right with the cogs and pulley system. When we removed a link, then it was then too tight and pulled the supporting tower over every few seconds. the red \"cups\" that carry the marbles up to the top also kept catching on the supporting base structure and falling off. NOTHING seemed to work right with the elevator portion of this toy ... Which is why we bought it. It's too expensive to just keep just to use as an addition to our regular set.

The early 90s hardly a high point in popular music- maybe that is why this band seemed to stand out. What I will never understand is why losing your life early in your career automatically gives legend status. Sid and Nancy already happened. So far as this book is concerned, maybe someone should have type-set this thing, while an editor pulled out whatever might have been seen as significant material worthy of publishing. To me, this looks like a pile of junk that some kid wrote while suffering from the mass-boredom of Study Hall... But then again, leaving some mystery is what keeps legends going. Now that any mystery has been removed, give us another 20 years and see if anybody still talks about Cobain the way they do Buddy Holly or Jimi Hendrix. With any respect due to Mr. Cobain- this pile of scribbles should have remained in the vault.\n",

I don't know what the hardcore Duran Duran fan will make of this DVD, but I was very disappointed. I expected this release to be a full, uninterrupted concert of some of their best songs. At least that's what it looks like reading the back of packaging. Instead you get 2/3 music along with stupid vignettes of aliens running around the building. DURING the songs. Not just one song, but every song performed during the concert drops out so we can see rejects from Star Wars running around behind the scenes. I guess the person who directed 'Thriller' decided to bring the production to a live concert. This was very annoying. You only get one full, uninterrupted track, 'Save A Prayer' in the bonus section of the DVD. Hardly what I would want to pay $30 for. This gets 2 stars for good picture and sound quality. Strong recommendation to avoid. I am taking this back ASAP.\n",

Unfortunately this story and accompanying artwork didn't come anywhere close to my expectations.I think Bendis' main strength (and what makes him beloved by Marvel) is his uncanny ability to create scenes (however improbable) that incorporate a ridiculous number of heroes and villains from the Marvel pantheon, which artists can later render into a graphic worthy of any geeky eight year old's bedspread / comforter or wall adornment. As far as telling a compelling story, in an interesting way, his work isn't much more impressive than the story lines of the 1960's Batman TV series.(So, no, I won't be tuning-in for more...same BENDIS-time, same BENDIS-drivel!!!)I'd happily trade this with anyone for more of Straczinski's work, however... :)\n",
